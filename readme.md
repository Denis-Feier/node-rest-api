# This is my first node.js REST API

Don't forget to run:
```
npm install
npm start # to run the app
```

Also, you need to have a .env file in the root dir for all the environment variables:

```
PORT=your port # you can leave this by default is 3000

MONGO_ATLES_URL=your mongo atles url

SECRET=secretOrPublicKey # can be any string
``` 

I have also added my postman collection for this project: ./First Node Project.json
